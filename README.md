# Airbnb-Data-Analysis-Dashboard

Problem Statement: This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends. The objectives are to: Establish a MongoDB connection, retrieve the Airbnb dataset, and ensure efficient data retrieval for analysis. Clean and prepare the dataset, addressing missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions for accurate analysis. Develop a streamlit web application with interactive maps showcasing the distribution of Airbnb listings, allowing users to explore prices, ratings, and other relevant factors. Conduct price analysis and visualization, exploring variations based on location, property type, and seasons using dynamic plots and charts. Analyze availability patterns across seasons, visualizing occupancy rates and demand fluctuations using suitable visualizations. Investigate location-based insights by extracting and visualizing data for specific regions or neighborhoods. Create interactive visualizations that enable users to filter and drill down into the data. Build a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI, combining various visualizations to present key insights from the analysis.

### Technologies needed for the project!
Plotly, Seaborn - (To plot and visualize the data)
Pandas - (To Clean and maipulate the data)
Pymongo - (To store and retrieve the data by connecting with MongoDB Atlas)
Streamlit - (To Create Graphical user Interface)
PowerBI - (To Create Interactive Dashboard for useful insights)

### What Is Airbnb?
Airbnb (ABNB) is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people looking for accommodations in specific locales. The company has come a long way since 2007, when its co-founders first came up with the idea to invite paying guests to sleep on an air mattress in their living room. According to Airbnb's latest data, it now has more than 7 million listings, covering some 100,000 cities and towns in 220-plus countries and regions worldwide.

### Features:
- Explore the highlights of the data from Airbnb through the dataframe and raw extracted data
- Observe the top trends of the data with insightful sorting by listings, room types and property types
- Explore the varying trends of housing through the Airbnb platform with the help of price analysis and availability analysis
- Take a deep dive into the visualizations of the airbnb data with the help of the powerful elements in PowerBI Dashboard


### Future Scope:
This project can further be developed with visualization techniques that are more intuitive and detailed.
